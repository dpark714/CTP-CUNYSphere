### Executive summary
**A summary of your project** <br />
In todayâ€™s vast digital landscape, students often face challenges in sourcing reliable academic resources and engaging with peers who share their educational pursuits. CUNYSphere is designed to address these challenges by serving as a comprehensive platform for students. Here's how it works:

### What does the application do?
CunySphere provides a two-fold service approach for students. Firstly, it offers a selection of vetted academic resources, assisting students in their studies. Secondly, it creates a dedicated space for students to interact, discuss, and collaborate on academic topics.


### What is the motivation for your application?
The driving force behind CUNYSphere is to address the existing gap in the market. Students often find themselves switching between platforms that are either off academic resources or community engagement. CUNYSphere aims to streamline the student experience by seamlessly integrating both aspects into a single platform. 


### Which types of people would want to use this application?
CUNYSphere is tailored specifically to college students, particularly those within the CUNY system. However, it can also benefit high school students who are considering attending CUNY college in the future. 


### Are there similar applications and/or competitors available now? How does your idea differ? or why is there a need for a competitor?
While there are existing platforms like CourseHero and CollegeConfidential that cater to student needs, they tend to address only one aspect of the student experience. CourseHero primarily focuses on providing study materials, while CollegeConfidential emphasizes student discussions. CUNYSphere sets itself apart by integrating academic resources with a vibrant community, offering students a holistic experience. This unique combination makes CUNYSphere a necessary addition to the current market.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
**Current version:** 3.0.0 (Oct 2023)

## Stack

> Node.js v16 LTS is recommended

_Backend API_

- express.js (v4.18.2)
- sequelize.js (v6.33.0)
- PostgreSQL (v14 recommended)

_Frontend React client_

- Based on `create-react-app`
  - pre-configured to work with the api
- Bootstrap (v5)
  - added to `/client/public/index.html` (_optional_ can be removed)
- React Router (v6)

## Development Setup

### Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed

- Check if you have PostgreSQL installed
  - âœ… versions 10-14 should work
  - ðŸš« version 15 has not been tested
- If you need to install PostgreSQL see the [installing PostgreSQL guides](https://github.com/CUNYTechPrep/guides#postgresql)

### Create a PostgreSQL user and database

The project-starter template expects the following for local development:

- PostgreSQL User/Role
  - name: `ctp_user`
  - password: `ctp_pass`
- PostgreSQL Database
  - name: `ctp_appdb_development`

#### For Windows/pgAdmin users

If you are on Windows and installed **pgAdmin** follow our [pgAdmin guide](https://github.com/CUNYTechPrep/guides/blob/master/pgAdmin-create-user-db.md) to create a user in PostgreSQL named `ctp_user` with the password `ctp_pass` and a database named `ctp_appdb_development`.

#### For Mac/Linux users

Create a user in PostgreSQL named `ctp_user` with the password `ctp_pass`:

> This only needs to be done one time on your machine
> You can create additional users if you want to.

```
createuser -P -s -e ctp_user
```

Create a separate db for this project:

```
createdb -h localhost -U ctp_user ctp_appdb_development
```

> You will create a DB for each project you start based on this repo. For other projects change `ctp_appdb_development` to the new apps database name.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
### Running the app locally

For local development you will need two terminals open, one for the api-backend and another for the react-client.

_Clone_ this app, then:

```bash
# api-backend terminal 1
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm run dev
```

```bash
# react-client terminal 2
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

- api-backend will launch at: http://localhost:8080
- react-client will launch at: http://localhost:3000

> In production you will only deploy a single app. The react client will build into static files that will be served from the backend.

### Hosting on [Render.com](https://render.com/) 

1. Create an account by clicking the __Get Started__ button
  - It's recommended to Sign up using your __Github__ account for easy linking to project repos.

  - Your database will be ready to use in 1-5 minutes.
  - Once the database is active, make note of where to get the Connection details, such as "__Internal Database URL__" and "__External Database URL__"
4. Create a Web Service
  - Click the __New +__ button at the top of the page
  - Select __Web Service__ from the drop down menu
  - Click on the __"Build and deploy from a Git repository"__ option and click __Next__
  - Connect to your project's repository on Github
  - Provide a __Name__ for your projects web app
  - Choose the same __Region__ as you chose for your database (_important for db connectivity_)
  - Choose the __Branch__ with the code you want to deploy (usually `main`)
  - Leave the __Root Directory__ empty
  - Choose __Runtime__: Node
  - Set __Build Command__: `npm install && npm run build`
  - Set __Start Command__: `npm start`
